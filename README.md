# iv-exercise-u

For this exercise I tried to implement pure javascript to solve the issue. 

As you can see I tried to implement jquery but I couldn't load the library, and I 
didn't want to spent a lot of time on researching at least for this exercise.

I let you the sources of some code and references used for this exercise:

I tried to implement the <video> tag but to show vimeo videos I need a pro account on vimeo so I implemented the iframe approach.

I'm not sure if the responsiveness is working as I didn't have enough time to test, (but I think I missed it), however I'd like to add in this notes that adding some styles with some @media queries and window sizes we can handle responsiveness, also with the use of flex boxes.

Also I'd like to add that the use of some libraries as bootstrap can help to improve the UX/UI.

I'm principally an front end developer I could think a lot of posibilities with the framework but I made my best to implement pure javascript, was a really cool challenge, thanks for the opportunity that helps me see I can improve everyday.

I hope this covers all the required job.
Greetings!
